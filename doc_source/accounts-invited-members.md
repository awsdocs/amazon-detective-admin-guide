# Managing invited member accounts<a name="accounts-invited-members"></a>

An administrator account can invite accounts to be member accounts in the behavior graph\. When a member account accepts the invitation and is enabled, Amazon Detective begins to ingest and extract the member account's data into that behavior graph\.

For behavior graphs other than the organization behavior graph, all of the member accounts are invited accounts\.

The Detective administrator account can also invite accounts that are not organization accounts to the organization behavior graph\.

The administrator account can remove invited member accounts from the behavior graph\.
