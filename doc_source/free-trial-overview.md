# About the free trial for behavior graphs<a name="free-trial-overview"></a>

When you enable Detective, and become the Detective master account for a behavior graph, a 30\-day free trial starts for the behavior graph\. Your account and your member accounts are not billed for any data processed during that period\.

Detective only allows one free trial for each combination of master account and Region\. For example, if an account deactivates Detective and then enables it again in the same Region, there is no free trial for the second time Detective is enabled\.

The free trial provides multiple benefits:
+ You can explore Detective features and functionality to verify its value before you start to pay for it\.
+ You can monitor the amount of data and the estimated cost before Detective begins to bill for it\. See [Monitoring Amazon Detective usage and cost](usage-tracking.md)\.

For the first two weeks after you enable Detective, Detective is in a training mode\. During the training period, Detective uses your data to establish baselines of your organization's typical behavior\. For more information about the training period for behavior graph data, see [Training period for new behavior graphs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/userguide/detective-data-training-period.html) in the *Detective User Guide*\.

During the free trial, Detective recommends that you add as many member accounts as you can to the behavior graph\. This provides Detective with a larger pool of data, which allows it to generate a more accurate picture of the normal activity for your organization\.

While the free trial is in effect, the **Settings** pages display a notification that indicates the free trial is in effect, and provides the date when the free trial ends\.

When the trial period ends, Detective begins to bill the master and member accounts for the data they contribute to the behavior graph\.
