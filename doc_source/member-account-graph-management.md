Amazon Detective charges each member account for the ingested data for each behavior graph that it contributes to\.

The **Account management** page allows member accounts to see the administrator accounts for the behavior graphs they are a member of\.

Member accounts that are invited to a behavior graph can view and respond to their invitations\. They can also remove their account from the behavior graph\.

For the organization behavior graph, organization accounts do not control whether their account is a member account\. The Detective administrator account chooses the organization accounts to enable or disable as member accounts\.
